# 🎯 SmartFocus

**SmartFocus** is our final year project developed as part of the **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA)** program at the **Institute of Technology and Management**, Department of Information Technology.

This project aims to improve users’ ability to maintain focus while studying or working. It provides a focus-tracking system that can operate in both **camera** and **non-camera** modes and generates detailed focus reports.

## 🧠 Project Overview
**SmartFocus** helps users monitor and analyze their concentration levels during study sessions.  
The project includes two separate implementations — one in **Python** and another in **Java** — allowing flexibility and comparison between the two languages.

The system primarily:
- Tracks user focus using camera input (via face detection / attention recognition).
- Supports a non-camera mode for simplified focus tracking.
- Generates detailed focus reports in `.csv` format for performance review.
